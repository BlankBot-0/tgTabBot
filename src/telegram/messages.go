First, you must specify bpm and guitar tuning like this (currently only 6-string tabs are supported):
BPM 120 E2 A2 D3 G3 B3 E4
The rest of the message is build from blocks of the following form:
'duration'('some tabs of said duration')

You can see /example where all current features are demonstrated or get detailed instructions with /instructions
Don't feel intimidated - it's easier to write than to read!
Currently I support dotted and/or tuplet durations, simple polyphony and bends.
